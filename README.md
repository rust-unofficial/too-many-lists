# Building

Building requires mdbook, which can be installed from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

Assuming you've placed the install directory `~/.cargo/bin` into your system PATH, then run from the root of your local copy:

```sh
mdbook build
```

---

If you'd prefer, this project can also be built with
[GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), although GitBook
is not officially supported and compatibility is therefore
uncertain and incidental.
