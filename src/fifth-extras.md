# Extra Junk

Now that `push` and `pop` are written, everything else is acutally exactly the same as the stack case, weirdly. Only operations that change the length of the list need to touch the tail pointer.

But of course, now that everything's unsafe pointers we need to rewrite the code to use those! And if we're going to be touching all the code, we might as well
take the chance to make sure we aren't missing something.

But anyway, let's start copy-pasting code from the stack implementation:

```rust ,ignore
// ...

pub struct IntoIter<T>(List<T>);

pub struct Iter<'a, T> {
    next: Option<&'a Node<T>>,
}

pub struct IterMut<'a, T> {
    next: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,
}
```

IntoIter looks fine, but `Iter` and `IterMut` are breaking our simple rule of never using safe pointers in our types anymore. Let's be safe and change those to use raw pointers:

```rust ,ignore
pub struct IntoIter<T>(List<T>);

pub struct Iter<'a, T> {
    next: *mut Node<T>,
}

pub struct IterMut<'a, T> {
    next: *mut Node<T>,
}

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter<T> {
        IntoIter(self)
    }

    pub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<'_, T> {
        Iter { next: self.head }
    }

    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<'_, T> {
        IterMut { next: self.head }
    }
}
```

Looks good!

Doesn't look good! What's this [PhantomData](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html) they're on about?

> Zero-sized type used to mark things that “act like” they own a `T`.

> Adding a `PhantomData<T>` field to your type tells the compiler that your type acts as though it stores a value of type `T`, even though it doesn’t really. This information is used when computing certain safety properties.

Hey don't get hasty there, we're reading the book that *I* wrote. Not that other book that some huge *nerd* probably wrote! I bet if they write a data structure in there it's something lame like an Array Stack and *not* a Linked List.

> Unused lifetime parameters
>
> Perhaps the most common use case for PhantomData is a struct that has an unused lifetime parameter, typically as part of some unsafe code.

Ah so we're naming a lifetime in our type but not actually using it. We *could* go down the PhantomData path, but I want to save that for the doubly-linked list in the next chapter that will *really* need it.

We're in an interesting situation where we actually don't need PhantomData. *I think*. I'm just going to claim that and trust that it's true, and if miri yells at us at the end I'll concede the point and we'll do the PhantomData thing.

What we're actually going to do is put the references back in these Iterator types and be happy we get to use references in some places still. I think that's sound because there's still a kind of proper nesting when you use an iterator: you create the iterator, use safe references for a while, and then discard the iterator. 

Only once the iterator is gone can you access the list and call things like `push` and `pop` which need to mess with the tail pointer and Boxes. Now, during the iteration we *are* going to be dereferencing a bunch of raw pointers, so there is a kind of mixing there, but we should be able to think of those references as reborrows of the unsafe pointers.

*I'm* not even 100% convinced but I just wanna give it a try and see!

```rust ,ignore
pub struct IntoIter<T>(List<T>);

pub struct Iter<'a, T> {
    next: Option<&'a Node<T>>,
}

pub struct IterMut<'a, T> {
    next: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,
}

impl<T> List<T> {
    pub fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter<T> {
        IntoIter(self)
    }

    pub fn iter(&self) -> Iter<'_, T> {
        unsafe {
            Iter { next: self.head.as_ref() }
        }
    }

    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<'_, T> {
        unsafe {
            IterMut { next: self.head.as_mut() }
        }
    }
}
```

If we're going to be storing references, we need to upgrade our raw pointers to options-of-references. We *could* check if the pointer is null, but this is one of the incredibly narrow cases where I *think* it's ok to use the nasty [ptr::as_ref](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_ref-1) and [ptr::as_mut](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_mut) methods.

I *usually* recommend avoiding these methods like the plague because they do some surprising and nasty stuff and they're inherently reintroducing references when my whole "easy rule" is to avoid doing that!

Those methods come with a lot of warnings, but the most interesting is this:

> You must enforce Rust’s aliasing rules, since the returned lifetime `'a` is arbitrarily chosen and does not necessarily reflect the actual lifetime of the data. In particular, for the duration of this lifetime, the memory the pointer points to must not get accessed (read or written) through any other pointer.

Hey look it's the thing we talked about for 25 pages! I have already asserted we're *definitely* going to be fine to use references here, so aliasing solved! The other evil part is the signature:

```rust ,ignore
pub unsafe fn as_mut<'a>(self) -> Option<&'a mut T>
```

Do you see how that lifetime isn't attached to the input at all, because `self` is by-value? Yeah that's what we call an "unbounded lifetime" and it's nasty stuff. It's willing to pretend to be as large as we ask it to be, even `'static`! The way you *deal* with that is by putting it somewhere that *is* bounded, which usually just means "return this from a function as soon as possible so that the function signature limits it".

Boy I'm nervous about this but we're gonna keep pushing through! Let's steal some iterator impls from the stack:

```rust ,ignore
impl<T> Iterator for IntoIter<T> {
    type Item = T;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.0.pop()
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for Iter<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.next.map(|node| {
            self.next = node.next.as_deref();
            &node.elem
        })
    }
}

impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {
    type Item = &'a mut T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.next.take().map(|node| {
            self.next = node.next.as_deref_mut();
            &mut node.elem
        })
    }
}
```

Moment of truth time...

YES!!! Take that **NARRATOR**! Sometimes I don't make mistakes!

> **NARRATOR**: but wasn't the whole point that the mistakes are there to teach the reader.

YEAH WELL SOMETIMES THE LESSON IS THAT I'M RIGHT AND EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO ME WHEN I SAY THINGS ABOUT UNSAFE CODE BECAUSE I HAVE SPENT FAR TOO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT THE SOUNDNESS OF ITERATOR IMPLEMENTATIONS?! OK?! OK.

Anyway here's `peek` and `peek_mut`.

```rust ,ignore
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    unsafe {
        self.head.as_ref()
    }
}

pub fn peek_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T> {
    unsafe {
        self.head.as_mut()
    }
}
```

I'm not even gonna test them because I never make mistakes anymore.

```

FINE.

```rust ,ignore
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    unsafe {
        self.head.as_ref().map(|node| &node.elem)
    }
}

pub fn peek_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T> {
    unsafe {
        self.head.as_mut().map(|node| &mut node.elem)
    }
}
```

I guess I am going to *continue* to make mistakes, so we're going to be extra careful and add a new test I'm going to call "miri food": something that just messes around and mixes up our APIs a bunch to help miri catch our mistakes.

```rust ,ignore
#[test]
fn miri_food() {
    let mut list = List::new();

    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);

    assert!(list.pop() == Some(1));
    list.push(4);
    assert!(list.pop() == Some(2));
    list.push(5);

    assert!(list.peek() == Some(&3));
    list.push(6);
    list.peek_mut().map(|x| *x *= 10);
    assert!(list.peek() == Some(&30));
    assert!(list.pop() == Some(30));

    for elem in list.iter_mut() {
        *elem *= 100;
    }

    let mut iter = list.iter();
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&400));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&500));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&600));
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);
    assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);

    assert!(list.pop() == Some(400));
    list.peek_mut().map(|x| *x *= 10);
    assert!(list.peek() == Some(&5000));
    list.push(7);

    // Drop it on the ground and let the dtor exercise itself
}
```
