# Peek

One thing we didn't even bother to implement last time was peeking. Let's go
ahead and do that. All we need to do is return a reference to the element in
the head of the list, if it exists. Sounds easy, let's try:

```rust ,ignore
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    self.head.map(|node| {
        &node.elem
    })
}
```

  --> src/second.rs:36:9
   |

   |         ^^^^^^^^^ cannot move out of borrowed content


```

*Sigh*. What now, Rust?

Map takes `self` by value, which would move the Option out of the thing it's in.
Previously this was fine because we had just `take`n it out, but now we actually
want to leave it where it was. The *correct* way to handle this is with the
`as_ref` method on Option, which has the following definition:

```rust ,ignore
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> Option<&T>;
}
```

It demotes the `Option<T>` to an Option to a reference to its internals. We could
do this ourselves with an explicit match but *ugh no*. It does mean that we
need to do an extra dereference to cut through the extra indirection, but
thankfully the `.` operator handles that for us.


```rust ,ignore
pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
    self.head.as_ref().map(|node| {
        &node.elem
    })
}
```

Nailed it.

We can also make a *mutable* version of this method using `as_mut`:

```rust ,ignore
pub fn peek_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T> {
    self.head.as_mut().map(|node| {
        &mut node.elem
    })
}
```

```

EZ

Don't forget to test it:

```rust ,ignore
#[test]
fn peek() {
    let mut list = List::new();
    assert_eq!(list.peek(), None);
    assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), None);
    list.push(1); list.push(2); list.push(3);

    assert_eq!(list.peek(), Some(&3));
    assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), Some(&mut 3));
}
```

```text
cargo test

test first::test::basics ... ok
test second::test::basics ... ok
test second::test::peek ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

```

That's nice, but we didn't really test to see if we could mutate that `peek_mut` return value, did we?  If a reference is mutable but nobody mutates it, have we really tested the mutability?  Let's try using `map` on this `Option<&mut T>` to put a profound value in:

```rust ,ignore
#[test]
fn peek() {
    let mut list = List::new();
    assert_eq!(list.peek(), None);
    assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), None);
    list.push(1); list.push(2); list.push(3);

    assert_eq!(list.peek(), Some(&3));
    assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), Some(&mut 3));
    list.peek_mut().map(|&mut value| {
        value = 42
    });

    assert_eq!(list.peek(), Some(&42));
    assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(42));
}
```

The compiler is complaining that `value` is immutable, but we pretty clearly wrote `&mut value`; what gives? It turns out that writing the argument of the closure that way doesn't specify that `value` is a mutable reference. Instead, it creates a pattern that will be matched against the argument to the closure; `|&mut value|` means "the argument is a mutable reference, but just copy the value it points to into `value`, please."  If we just use `|value|`, the type of `value` will be `&mut i32` and we can actually mutate the head:

```rust ,ignore
    #[test]
    fn peek() {
        let mut list = List::new();
        assert_eq!(list.peek(), None);
        assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), None);
        list.push(1); list.push(2); list.push(3);

        assert_eq!(list.peek(), Some(&3));
        assert_eq!(list.peek_mut(), Some(&mut 3));

        list.peek_mut().map(|value| {
            *value = 42
        });

        assert_eq!(list.peek(), Some(&42));
        assert_eq!(list.pop(), Some(42));
    }
```

Much better!
